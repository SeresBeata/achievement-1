### Introduction

This HTML skeleton project was created with VSCode Emmet HTML boilerplate. It contains basic HTML elements. In the future, further development is expected, as a completion of a Portfolio Website with CSS and more HTML content.

### Technologies

- HTML5

### Setup

- Install Live Server package in VSCode
- Open home.html file with Live Server

### WC3 Validator Result

_Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show._
**BUT:** _Info - Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values._

### The most challenging

_Your browser has cached your site as one without a favicon. When you add a favicon to your site, it may not show up since your browser has 'saved' your site as one without a favicon. You need to clear the cache in your browser or use a different browser._
